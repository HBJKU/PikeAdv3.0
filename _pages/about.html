<h3> How it all began</h3>

Abigail and I met in a blizzard on a cold day in December 2010. I helped her push her car off the road, and we have been together ever since. After 5 years we got married. On January 31st, on Mount Washington. At the bottom is was 20 â„‰, with the wind it was well into the negatives as we went up.

After marriage, came two beautiful kids and the real adventure started. We both wanted them to experience the world we live in and not be slaves to technology. We tried camping a few times, but ground camping with a tent and small children just never seemed to work out for us.

Soon we heard of a trip my in-laws were making out west. Abigail's grandfather's cousin, owned and operated a cattle farm in South Dakota.  We quickly invited ourselves and began planning our first Overland trip out west. 

After watching many YouTube videos on how people live and travel across the country, we soon decided to buy a SmittBilt Overland XL Roof Top Tent. And the rest is history
